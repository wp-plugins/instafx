```* [instafx src="" width="" height="" title="" rel="" class="" id="" before="" after=""  effect="" ]
* [instafx src="" width="" height="" title="" rel="" class="" id="" before="" after=""  effect="" ] Your Content contain image [/instafx]
* [instafx width="" height="" title="" rel="" class="" id="" before="" after=""  effect="" ] Your Content contain image [/instafx]```
